***👋 Hello, World! I'm Henrik! :)***

🌱 I'm a Systems Information student, passionate about **web and multiplatform development**. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills, and I love collaborating with the tech community on GitHub.

💻 My foundation includes **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with practical experience in **React** for building interfaces and applications. I focus on **intuitive UI/UX and responsiveness**, utilizing tools like Figma for prototyping.

🚀 I've developed projects like **Lumiere** (a web recommendation application) and **Pomodoro** (a multiplatform app built with React and Electron), where I applied my knowledge and gained hands-on experience in real-world scenarios. You can explore these and other projects right here on my GitHub!

🛠️ Additionally, I'm familiar with **Python and MySQL** for backend solutions and data management.

🎮 Outside of coding, I enjoy playing chess, listening to jazz music, exploring 80s songs, and watching classic Hollywood movies.
